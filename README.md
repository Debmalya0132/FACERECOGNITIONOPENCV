# FaceRecognition using OpenCV and Python



# Project Outline 



## 2. Basic Concepts:
- Reading Images and Video 
- Resizing and Rescaling Images and Video Frames 
- Drawing Shapes and Placing text on images 
- 5 Essential Methods in OpenCV 
- Image Transformations 
- Contour Detection 
    
## 3. Advanced Concepts:
- Switching between Colour Spaces (RGB, BGR, Grayscale, HSV and L*a*b) 
- Splitting and Merging Colour Channels 
- Blurring 
- BITWISE operations 
- Masking 
- Histogram Computation 
- Thresholding/Binarizing Images 
- Advanced Edge Detection
    
## 4. Face Detection and Recognition
- Face Detection using Haar Cascades
- Face Recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm 
    
## 5. FaceRecognition: Deep Computer Vision
- Building a Deep Computer Vision model to classify between the characters in the popular TV series Game of Thrones
